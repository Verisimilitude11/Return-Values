# Return-Values
  # What is the syntax for returning a value?
  Syntax:
      * The value can be any value or variable from within the function
      * When returning a variable, the variable name is still only usable within the scope of the function
      * Still causes the function to end early
      ```
      return value
      ```
  # What can be done with returned values?
  * The function call is "replaced" with the return values
  * Functions that return values are expressions
  * Can be used anywhere expressions are used, including:
  * Right side of assignment statements (variable = function call)
  * Print out the value
  * Conditions
  * Part of a larger calculation
